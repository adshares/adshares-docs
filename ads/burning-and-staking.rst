Burning and staking ADS
================================

ADS Burning
---------------------
Adshares approach to burning. We have two burn-like mechanisms embedded in our system. One is in blockchain itself - staking. We put all fees collected from transfers and other blockchain operations into liquid staking fund. Staking funds are then proportionally given to ADS holders every 2048 blocks (around 12 days). This creates mechanism that ADS are flowing from active users (who pay fees) to long term holders. This in turn reduces free floating supply.
Second scheme is tied to application layer. Our Adserver network works around principle that 1% of ad turnover is sent to a certain ADS Address. Those funds will be locked forever or at least until we establish DAO-style governance and there will be future decision to employ those funds for network benefit. We also build same mechanism in our future services, such as soon to be launched Adshares Social services, that will enable advertisers to buy paid promotion on social networks in decentralized manner.

Adshares (ADS) Liquid Staking
---------------------------------------
The fees charged by the network are added to liquid staking fund. However, each masternode involved in the transaction has an operating fee and its operator account receives 1/5 of the transaction fee and the remaining part of the collected fee goes to the liquid staking fund.
Every 2048 blocks (~ 2 weeks) the staking fund is distributed proportionally between all accounts with a positive ADS balance and activity in last 12 months. For example, if there are 100,000 ADS in a staking fund, a person with 387582 ADS (1% of the total) will receive 1000 ADS of the reward, while a person with 3875 ADS will receive 10 ADS of the staking reward.

ADS Wallet inactivity fee
--------------------------------------
There is a small inactivity fee after 2 years to encourage regular checking of key backups and prevent permanent loss of coins. The inactivity fee is 1 promile every 2048 blocks. Funds from the account go into a liquid staking fund. Thanks to this mechanism, uninterrupted network activity is ensured. We encourage you to log into your account and make at least one empty transaction during the year.
We will also soon be introducing wrapped ADS on Ethereum as an ERC20 token. This will allow you to own wrapped ADS and not have to worry about inactivity, as it will be handled by the wrapping gateway. However, it is worth remembering that the wrapped ADS token will not participate in the liquid staking.
