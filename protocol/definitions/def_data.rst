Data Structures
---------------

.. _protocol-definitions-platformmetadata:

Platform Metadata
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A manifest describing all the significant information about :ref:`Supply-Side Platform <protocol-definitions-ssp>` or :ref:`Demand-Side Platform <protocol-definitions-dsp>`.
:ref:`Platform Metadata <protocol-definitions-platformmetadata>` is broadcast regularly via :ref:`ADS Blockchain <protocol-definitions-blockchain>`,
as part of the :ref:`Synchronization <protocol-synchronization>` process.


.. _protocol-definitions-supplyinventory:

Supply-Side Inventory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A manifest describing the parameters of a :ref:`Site <protocol-definitions-site>` currently offered by a :ref:`Publisher <protocol-definitions-publisher>`, 
e.g. topic, prevailing audience etc.

.. _protocol-definitions-demandinventory:

Demand-Side Inventory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A manifest describing the parameters of a :ref:`Campaign <protocol-definitions-campaign>` currently run 
by an :ref:`Advertiser <protocol-definitions-advertiser>`, e.g. time duration, target audience, pricing policy etc.

From the technical perspective, :ref:`Demand-Side Inventory <protocol-definitions-demandinventory>` is an array of :ref:`Campaign Objects <protocol-campaign-object>`.

.. note::
    In centralize ecosystems the term *inventory* refers only to the supply side of the market, i.e. what :ref:`Publishers<protocol-definitions-publisher>` 
    offer for sale and the minimum price they are willing to accept from :ref:`Advertisers <protocol-definitions-advertiser>`. 
    However, in :ref:`Adshares Protocol <adshares-protocol>` this term has a more generic meaning, as it refers to assets that belong to either side of the market, 
    i.e. :ref:`Publishers<protocol-definitions-publisher>` or :ref:`Advertisers <protocol-definitions-advertiser>`.

.. _protocol-definitions-creativeobject:

Creative Object
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A data payload describing a :ref:`Creative <protocol-definitions-creative>`. Among other things, it includes the hash (or checksum) of 
:ref:`Creative Content <protocol-definitions-creativecontent>` and the following URLs exposed by :ref:`Demand-Side Platform <protocol-definitions-dsp>`:

* an endpoint for retrieving :ref:`Creative Content <protocol-definitions-creativecontent>`
* an endpoint for reporting :ref:`View Events <protocol-definitions-viewevent>`
* an endpoint for reporting :ref:`Click Events <protocol-definitions-clickevent>`

For full details of the payload schema, refer to :ref:`Creative Object <protocol-creative-object>` section of 
:ref:`Demand-Side Inventory Format <protocol-synchronization-demandinventory-format>`.

.. _protocol-definitions-creativecontent:

Creative Content
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Digital assets (e.g. images, videos etc) needed to render a :ref:`Creative <protocol-definitions-creative>` 
inside its designated :ref:`Placement <protocol-definitions-placement>`.

.. _protocol-definitions-contextdata:

Context Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^
A package of data describing a :ref:`User <protocol-definitions-user>`, a :ref:`Site <protocol-definitions-site>` or a :ref:`Device <protocol-definitions-device>`.

.. _protocol-definitions-contextscript:

Context Script
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Executable code generated by :ref:`Context Provider <protocol-definitions-cp>`, and executed inside a sandbox created by
:ref:`Supply-Side Agent <protocol-definitions-ssa>` within the context of a :ref:`Site <protocol-definitions-site>`.

.. _protocol-definitions-paymentreport:

Payment Report
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A list of payments from :ref:`Demand-Side Platform <protocol-definitions-dsp>` to :ref:`Supply-Side Platform <protocol-definitions-ssp>`.
The list contains the business context explaining what a given payment amount is for. :ref:`Payment Reports <protocol-definitions-paymentreport>`
are generated by :ref:`Ad Pay Module <protocol-definitions-apm>`, and then they are utilized by :ref:`Demand-Side Platform <protocol-definitions-dsp>` to
execute the payments, and finally they are requested by :ref:`Supply-Side Platform <protocol-definitions-ssp>` to analyze the received payments.
:ref:`Payment Reports <protocol-definitions-paymentreport>` are standardized and need to adhere to :ref:`Payment Report Format <protocol-payments-report-format>`.
