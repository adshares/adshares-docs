How to use Advertising Ecosystem
===================================

.. note::

    Before using our decentralized advertising ecosystem you can try out the demo version.
    :ref:`Adshares Advertising Ecosystem Demo <how-to-use-advertising-ecosystem-demo>` can be used to get familiar with all the features of the platform.
    It is necessary to join Testnet before using the demo.

We have also created a `demo website <http://adshar.es/demosite>`_, which showcases how ad banners can be displayed on publishers' sites, depending on the device and the screen size.

Introduction
------------

Adshares Advertising Ecosystem is the first 100% decentralized advertising network for programmatic advertising, with AdServers being some of its key components.

The first step to join the Adshares network as a publisher or as an advertiser is setting up an account on one of the AdServers. After registering and logging in there are two panels available - one for advertisers and one for publishers. Each of the panels offers a wide selection of settings and options. Both the advertisers and the publishers have access to history, as well as to e-mail and password settings. Apart from AdServers, the network consists of components listed and described below.

Key components
--------------

Advertiser module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Defining campaigns, setting campaign budget and targeting. Before launching a campaign, the advertiser has to deposit funds the account and provide a minimum amount for a 1-hour campaign. Once all is set, the campaign, along with all related information, is distributed across the network. Based on the results, funds are transferred every hour directly to the publisher.

Publisher module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Registering websites on which banners will be displayed, generating code to be placed on websites. This module automatically scans the network in search of ads.

AdSelect module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Handling ads display. AdSelect learns based on interaction history, views, payments and credibility of the advertiser. The module optimizes ad selection to maximize publishers' revenue. As soon as the advertisement is selected and the campaign is live, all events are passed to the Advertiser module and the Publisher module.

AdPay module
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Calculating funds. Based on campaign results, the AdPay module decides once per hour how much should be transferred from the advertiser to the publisher. The transfer is made every hour, and the publisher can withdraw funds instantly. The advertiser sets the total budget for the entire campaign and the maximum budget for a specific event.

How to use the AdServer – instruction for Advertisers
-----------------------------------------------------

First, you need to `join one of the AdServers <https://adshares.net/network>`_ and confirm your registration via an email. Before you start a new campaign, you have to `deposit funds to your account <#how-to-deposit-funds-to-your-account>`_. You can make a deposit using our native ADS coin or over 30 other cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. In case you would like to use ADS coins but don't have any, :ref:`click here to learn how to get ADS <how-to-get-ads>`.

The next step is selecting the advertiser's dashboard, where you will find all the campaign settings. The entire process begins with creating a new campaign, choosing settings and uploading ad banners. After clicking the "Create new campaign" button located in the top menu, it's necessary to enter some basic information, such as campaign name, max CPM, start/end date, etc. Next, you can set some optional targeting and move on to adding your ads. It's possible to upload banner ads in HTML or jpg, png, and gif formats. You can also use pop-up and pop-under ads.

Your ads will be displayed on our partners' websites. Once your campaign is up and running, you can check how each of the ads is performing and make some adjustments if needed. In case of banner ad campaigns, we advise using at least 6-8 `most popular banner sizes <https://adshares.net/units>`_ to get the best results.

All events are balanced on an hourly basis, and payments are made instantly, which helps optimize campaign settings.

Next, you need to select ad categories you don’t want to display on your site. These settings apply both to the banner ads  and the pop-ups/pop-unders. If you decide not to exclude any categories, all available ads will be displayed on your site - e.g. gambling, crypto, investment.

How to use pop-up and pop-under ads
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you go through the exclusions, you can move on to pop-up/pop-under ads settings. Activating these ads lets publishers generate higher revenue.

Once the site is added, it is necessary to get the pop-up and/or pop-under ad code and place it on the site, which is the last part of the process of adding a new site. A detailed description is available below. Pop-ups/pop-unders will be displayed in a separate browser window. The content of ads that will be displayed is determined by the content type selection made by the user in the previous step. After selecting all the exclusions and going through the pop-up ads settings you can move on to banner ads sizes.

Once you are done, please move on to summary, check if all the settings are correct and publish the site. Next, you need to get the code and add it to your site.

How to place an ad unit on a Wordpress website
----------------------------------------------

The code can be generated and placed on a website in the way described above, however, we have also developed a `plugin for WordPress websites <http://adshar.es/wordpress>`_ that provides integration with Adshares AdServer. It makes the implementation even more straightforward and automates the process of placing the code on a website.

The installation is very simple. You just need to go to Your Website -> Plugins -> Add New, search for "Adshares" and click "Install Now". There is also an `alternative installation <https://wordpress.org/plugins/adshares/#installation>`_ for those who prefer to use Composer.

Once the plugin is installed, all you need to do is type in AdServer url address as "Server URL", log in into your Adshares account using your registration credentials, and select which ad units will be displayed. The plugin supports various options for position and visibility.
